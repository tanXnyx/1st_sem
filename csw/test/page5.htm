    <h2>Data science</h2>
    Data science is the study of data to extract meaningful insights for business. It is a multidisciplinary approach
    that combines principles and practices from the fields of mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, and
    computer engineering to analyze large amounts of data. This analysis helps data scientists to ask and answer
    questions like what happened, why it happened, what will happen, and what can be done with the results. <br>
