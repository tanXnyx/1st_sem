    <h2>Internet of Things</h2>
    The term IoT, or Internet of Things, refers to the collective network of connected devices and the technology that
    facilitates communication between devices and the cloud, as well as between the devices themselves. Thanks to the
    advent of inexpensive computer chips and high bandwidth telecommunication, we now have billions of devices connected
    to the internet. This means everyday devices like toothbrushes, vacuums, cars, and machines can use sensors to
    collect data and respond intelligently to users.

    The Internet of Things integrates everyday “things” with the internet. Computer Engineers have been adding sensors
    and processors to everyday objects since the 90s. However, progress was initially slow because the chips were big
    and bulky. Low power computer chips called RFID tags were first used to track expensive equipment. As computing
    devices shrank in size, these chips also became smaller, faster, and smarter over time. <br>
