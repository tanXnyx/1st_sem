 <p style="color: slateblue;">Charles	Babbage	invented	the	first	mechanical	computer.	
Perhaps,	this	is	why	he	got	the	title	of	“Father	of	Computers”.	Modern	computers	
are based on his analytical machine.</p>
	 <p		style="color:	dodgerblue;">Among	the	early	inventors	of	computers,	Lady	Ada	
Lovelace was perhaps one of the most remarkable one. She is often credited
to	be	the	first	ever	programmer.	Additionally,	she	was	the	first	one	to	use	an	
algorithm.</p>
